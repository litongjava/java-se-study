     Blowin' In The Wind
     How many roads must a man walk down
     Before you call him a man?
     How many seas must a white dove sail
     Before she sleeps in the sand?
     Yes, and how many times must the cannonballs fly
     Before they're forever banned?
     The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
     The answer is blowin' in the wind
     Yes, and how many years must a mountain exist
     Before it is washed to the sea?
     And how many years can some people exist
     Before they're allowed to be free?
     Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
     And pretend that he just doesn't see?
     The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
     The answer is blowin' in the wind
     Yes, and how many times must a man look up
     Before he can see the sky?
     And how many ears must one man have
     Before he can hear people cry?
     Yes, and how many deaths will it take 'til he knows
     That too many people have died?
     The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
     The answer is blowin' in the wind
